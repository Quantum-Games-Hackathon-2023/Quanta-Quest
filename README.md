## How to Play
1. The player starts as a quantum explorer searching for a key to unlock a treasure chest.
2. Learn and apply various quantum gates to proceed through different levels.
3. Assemble a teleportation circuit to finally acquire the key.

## Endgame Objective
After mastering various quantum gates and learning about superposition and entanglement, you'll be tasked with assembling a teleportation circuit. Successfully executing this quantum operation will grant you the key to the treasure chest. What lies inside? That's for you to find out!

## Quantum Gates
- **X Gate**: Also known as a Pauli-X gate, it flips the state of a qubit.
- **Z Gate**: Known as a Pauli-Z gate, it applies a phase flip to the qubit.
- **H gate**: Creates a superpostion of two states.
- **CX (Controlled Not) gate**: It flips the target state if the control state is 1. It is used here to generate entanglement.
